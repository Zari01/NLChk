# NLChk
IV/Nature Combination Validity Checker for Pokemon XD: Gale of Darkness and Pokemon Colosseum
- All XD:GoD Pokemon bar Poochyena, Ledyba, and the Hexagon Brothers' Pokemon are currently supported
- Colosseum Pokemon are NOT supported by NLChk right now; it's in the works for a future installment, however

How to Use NLChk:

Download NLChk.py from this repository, and place it in a folder directory you can remember; from here what you can do is split into 2 paths.
- If you have installed a version of python newer than 2.7.2 (which NLChk is currently written in), you'll need to open up a command prompt window and get to the directory you placed NLChk.py within (either by using "cd <directory>" to move up a directory to <directory> (or down a directory if you replace <directory> with "..")
  - Once in the directory NLChk.py is in (in command prompt), type "python NLChk.py". Assuming you haven't fiddled with your     default python version for command line, this will launch the program which will then prompt you for necessary input. (if you HAVE changed your default python version for command line, this little guide is most likely worthless to you. owo)
- Or, if you haven't done the above, simply download NLChk.py, place it in a directory you can remember, and double left-click it to open it.
    
  Note that NLChk.py will export 2x text files (or append to pre-existing ones generated by itself) into the directory it is placed in; these will be named "NLChk_Valid.txt" and "NLChk_Invalid.txt" for passing and failing results found, respectively.
  Also note that the invalid text file will essentially explode (with a massive number of entries) if you do a wide-range search, so it's best to limit the amount of possibilities you search at a time (within reason).
